# pypasswordchecker
Uses the pwnedpasswords api

checks if password has ever been hacked.
Although this is setup to be  used from the CL you should probably read for
a temp  text file or come up with some other way to input passwords to program.
A keylogger or other software can see and/or memorize your  keystrokes, e.g.,
CL recall.  This is not  very secure.
